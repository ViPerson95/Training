# Community News and Events

This project provides a simple Flask-based web application to share community news and upcoming events.
When the app starts, it randomly generates demo news articles and events so you can see sample content right away.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

The default styles use a green color palette and subtle geometric pattern inspired by Islamic art.
